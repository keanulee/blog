Hi! My name is Keanu Lee and I am a software developer. I'm currently a university student majoring in Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and Business Administration at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://wlu.ca).

Keanu's Tech Ramblings is a blog that highlights some of the work I do. Topics of interest include web development and Polymer.
